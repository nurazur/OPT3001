## examples for AVR0 series and AVR DD and DA series MCU's

AVR0 series are ATmega4808, ATmega4809, ATmega3208 etc.
AVR DD and DA series are AVRxxDDyy and AVRxxDAyy devices, where xx is the flash size and yy is the pin count.

Examples were tested on ATmega4808 and AVR64DD32 based TiNo2 devices.

Any device supported by MegacoreX or DxCore will be working, Arduino IDE as well as platformio
